# Kodee

Kodee is a productivity app designed to reduce hassle and improve productivity by bringing together features from various applications into one place. This app is made with Golang, Wails v2, React, and Typescript/Javascript. The Windows installer can be found in `build/bin/kodee-amd64-installer.exe`. 

## Features

Kodee currently has no feature fully implemented yet. But I have plans to add more and more feature by time.

### Health Reminder

Kodee's Health Reminder feature notifies users to stand up, drink water, and take a break from their computer after a certain amount of time. This feature also provides suggestions for exercises to relieve neck, waist, and other pains commonly associated with long-term computer use. Additionally, there is a sub-feature that reminds users of prayer time for Muslims that can be toggled on or off.

## Requirements

To use the Kodee codebase, you will need the following:

- Go version v1.18+
- Wails v2
- Node.js v18
